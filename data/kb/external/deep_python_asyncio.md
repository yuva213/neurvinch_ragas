# Python `asyncio` — Asynchronous I/O

`asyncio` is a library to write concurrent code using the `async/await` syntax.
It is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

`asyncio` is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.

## Hello World Example

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print('Hello ...')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('... World!')

asyncio.run(main())
```

## High-level APIs

`asyncio` provides a set of high-level APIs to:

- run Python coroutines concurrently and have full control over their execution;
- perform network IO and IPC;
- control subprocesses;
- distribute tasks via queues;
- synchronize concurrent code;

## Low-level APIs

Additionally, there are low-level APIs for library and framework developers to:

- create and manage event loops, which provide asynchronous APIs for networking, running subprocesses, handling OS signals, etc;
- implement efficient protocols using transports;
- bridge callback-based libraries and code with async/await syntax.

## asyncio REPL

You can experiment with an `asyncio` concurrent context in the REPL:

```shell
$ python -m asyncio
asyncio REPL ...
Use "await" directly instead of "asyncio.run()".
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import asyncio
>>> await asyncio.sleep(10, result='hello')
'hello'
```

This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms (`WASI`).
